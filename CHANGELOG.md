# Changelog

Notable user-facing changes per release. Versions map to App Store releases;
unreleased work accumulates at the top.

## Unreleased

- **meshyy transport (opt-in, beta):** a session can run over meshyy, a
  clean-room resumable terminal transport — a dropped connection resumes
  where it left off instead of reconnecting into a fresh shell. Typing
  `exit` closes the tab like a real terminal, and a resumed terminal
  re-learns the running program's input modes, so tmux scrolling still
  works after an auto-resume. Off by default. (#131, #137)
- **Agent notifications:** the phone tells you when an agent is waiting on
  an answer, and one tap answers it from a quick-actions palette. A wait
  you have already seen stays quiet until you answer, and quiet output is
  no longer mistaken for "waiting". Agent status is surfaced where you
  are already looking. (#132, #138, #139, #140, #143, #149)
- **Sessions widget:** a home-screen widget that lists live sessions and
  opens exactly the session it shows. (#135, #136)
- **Agent icons:** agents get their real faces across the app, with a
  hand-drawn doodle set as the default and support for custom icons,
  sized to fit the Dynamic Island. (#143, #144, #145, #146, #148)
- **Fixes:** returning from a preview refocuses the terminal program, and
  the Sessions widget orders sessions correctly (#136); tapping an agent
  notification no longer races connect into a crash (#142); scrolling is
  consistent and alerts are honest about state (#145); the session picker
  keeps its payload and a swipe stays off the status line (#147).

## 1.0.3 (build 43) — 2026-08-01

- **Preview pop-out and console:** a preview can now be popped out into the
  same floating window the Monitor uses — which is also the only way to keep
  it running while you're in another app, since the tunnel lives only as long
  as a+Terminal does. And because a phone has no developer tools, Settings →
  Preview can mirror the page's `console.log` into a pane inside the sheet.
  That one is off by default: it's the only part of Preview that injects
  anything into your page. Captured lines stay in memory and are discarded
  when the sheet closes.
- **In-app localhost preview:** a dev server running on the machine you're
  SSH'd into can now be viewed inside a+Terminal. Tap a `http://localhost:…`
  link in the terminal, or pick a port from the preview sheet — a+Terminal
  detects them from what your server printed and from what's actually
  listening — and the port is forwarded over the SSH connection you already
  have. Hot reload and WebSockets work, because the tunnel carries raw bytes
  instead of rewriting the page. Previously such a link opened in Safari,
  where `localhost` meant the phone and the load simply failed.
  Loopback-only and foreground-only by design: the listener on the phone is
  bound to `127.0.0.1` so nothing else on your network can reach it, the
  preview refuses to navigate anywhere that isn't loopback, and it keeps no
  cookies or site data.
- **Floating pop-out (Picture-in-Picture):** pop a Monitor (VNC) screen out
  into a small floating window to keep watching your Mac while you use other
  apps — the window shows live video of the screen. Tap it to jump back in;
  the system pause button freezes it. (A connected terminal session can also
  be popped out as a view-only surface.) Off by default (Settings →
  Pop-Out), with an optional auto pop-out on app switch. Never interrupts
  your music.
- **Monitor cursor bridge:** link a monitor to the same machine's saved SSH
  server and the remote pointer's real position streams over SSH — the
  cursor now tracks the physical mouse and anything running on the Mac, not
  just your own taps (macOS screen sharing reports nothing about the cursor,
  so this is the only way to show it). Optional; nothing changes if unlinked.
- **Monitor Control mode:** an opt-in toggle turns the view-only monitor
  into a remote control — tap to click, drag to drag, long-press to
  right-click, plus a keyboard sheet (secure text entry, Return/Esc/Tab/
  Delete) that can type a password into a locked Mac's login screen.
  View-only remains the default; nothing is ever sent until you enable it.
- Monitor (VNC): the remote mouse cursor is now visible, drawn by the app
  at the position your touches drive (macOS never draws a cursor into
  screen-sharing streams — verified against a real host; servers that
  report cursor position are also supported).
- **Monitor (VNC, beta):** a view-only window onto your own computer's screen
  sharing. macOS (ARD) authentication lands straight on the desktop; classic
  VNC password and no-auth servers are supported too. Pinch-zoom and pan;
  the same pop-out monitoring works on the remote screen. No keyboard,
  pointer, or clipboard data is ever sent to the host, and the connection
  goes only to the host you enter (use Tailscale or an SSH tunnel as
  transport — classic VNC's own encryption is weak).

## 1.0.2 (build 29) — 2026-07-13

- Settings shows the app version and build.
- Live Activity: recovers from system-ended activities without an app
  restart; proactive background wind-down no longer races the expiration
  watchdog.
- Discovered servers connect over VPN/LTE via candidate-host fallback.

## 1.0.1 (build 22) — 2026-07-04

- Live Activity persists paused sessions until the session closes.
- Path-aware reconnect, host-key review + explicit re-pin flow, Bonjour
  hostname support, App Intents ("Connect to Server", "Wake Server"),
  ECDSA key import/auth/export.

## 1.0 (build 18) — 2026-06-27

- Initial App Store release.
